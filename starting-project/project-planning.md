# Beginning a Project

For your Bangazon projects, you interact with one customer: your manager. Your manager will be your point person on your customer needs - all feedback will come through your manager. 

Your goal for the Bangazon course and for your projects is to create potentially usable products using the Scrum. This involves making incremental delivery of functionality each sprint.

1. Refine your project idea. If you are not given user stories or tickets to begin your process, or, if you are starting a project from scratch (like for your capstones), spend extra time in your initial planning and do a user story mapping. At the end of this initial planning stage you should have a backlog of work to complete.

1. Understand your requirements. When you have project requirements from your manager, read them through carefully to understand what they really want from you. Don't assume you need any functionality not outlined in your requirements. If you have any questions at all about the requirements you were given, it's important to get clarification from your manager as early as possible. There's nothing worse than having to roll back code because you and your manager aren't on the same page in your expectations.

1. Prioritize your work. When considering your requirements, you should give the most importance to the tickets that give the most value to your customers. For instance, you should never create a user account profile page before you complete the ticket to log in users. No one in your app could use the profile page without an account, so if would provide no value to your users.

1. Follow your scrum guidelines when you begin development. Be sure to plan each sprint according to the amount of work your team thinks they can complete in a sprint. If you team is concerned a ticket will take more that one sprint to complete, break your tickets down into multiple technical tasks and/or use the relative sizing process to help determine what can be done in one sprint. It's normal to have a "healthy" backlog of two or more sprints of work. The important thing is not how fast you can get the whole project completed, but how your team can complete your project together in as many incremental steps (sprints) as you need.
