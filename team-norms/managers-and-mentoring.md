# Bangazon Managers and Mentoring

Your manager provides all the mentoring and guidance that you need while you build the Bangazon Platform. This includes training you on foundational concepts, tooling, and procedures. Your manager will also provide you with instruction to show you how to implement basic examples of the code that you will need for a larger project.

## What can you expect from your manager?

**Training on concepts** - Learning is a collaborative process that includes lecture, live coding, exercises, instructional videos, and group work. You'll experience training using all of these and more.

**Feedback** - Your manager is your point person on the instruction staff for your Bangazon projects, and your manager will review pull requests and provide feedback on an as-needed basis

**Arbitration in team disputes** - All team conflicts should be resolved through the scrum retrospective and normal team processes, but your manager can facilitate resolution to conflicts that get out of hand. NOTE: In your career as a software developer, you will work with people you don't see eye-to-eye with, so you should do your best to resolve personality conflicts with your teammates quickly and with the least amount of drama possible. Try creating team norms to resolve issues early.
