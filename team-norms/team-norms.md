# Team Norms

Your team may never see a need to establish or update your team norms beyond what's been given to you, but if your team is not being effective due to interpersonal issues or because of a lack a ground rules, you should spend a little time creating your team norms.

### What are team norms?

Team norms are relationship guidelines. They may lay out specifics of meeting times, how long a teammate should try to resolve a problem before asking a teammate for help, expectations around pull requests and code reviews, and level of participation and effort. (Google for some other examples)

If you can't think of anything more that you want to lay out as a team norm, congratulations. You have an effective team! You probably don't need a norms meeting.

### How do you create Team Norms?

Have each team member write each of their proposed team norms on sticky notes. Have everyone place their sticky notes on a wall or whiteboard. As a group, consider each sticky note and discuss as a team. Do you agree this is something your team needs to do? Do you pledge to follow the norm? If you don't have complete buy-in from your team members, re-write the suggestion to get buy-in or try to come up with a better norm that encompasses more points of view. Only once *every team member* has agreed to the norm can it be added to your team norms list. Remember, these meetings are based on trust, so never commit to something you won't do, and always treat a person's suggestion with respect.
