# Retrospective

Once your team completes a project, your team, along with your manager, will conduct a [Retrospective](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/scrum/sprint-retrospective). Be sure to read the description of the retrospective before attending your first one.

### What is a retrospective?

A sprint retrospective is a meeting where you review how the process of the last sprint went: what worked, what didn't, and how it can be improved (or start doing, stop doing, and continue doing). It can also be a time to add and revise your team norms (if your team is using team norms). Retrospectives are important because they help make your team function smoothly and efficiently. You'll be able to refine your process and prevent recurring problems in your sprints.

Retrospectives are held at the end of one sprint and before the next sprint begins. Usually the suggestions from the retro are directly applied to how the next sprint is tackled by the team.

### How should it be held?

With either a whiteboard or a wall and sticky notes, make three columns: what went well, what went wrong, and suggested improvements (or start doing, stop doing, and continue doing). Each person should take a marker or sticky notes and add to each of the lists as needed. There's no limit to how many suggestions one person can make (within reason), but every person should be involved in adding items, even if it is just to concur with what's already suggested by others. If there's a lot of topics on the board, have the team vote on which topics should be discussed; otherwise, discuss each item.
