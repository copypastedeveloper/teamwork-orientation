# Retrospective

Once your team completes a project, your team, along with your manager, will conduct a [Retrospective](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/scrum/sprint-retrospective). Be sure to read the description of the retrospective before attending your first one.

### What is a retrospective?

A sprint retrospective is a meeting where you review how the process of the last sprint went: what worked, what didn't, and how it can be improved (or start doing, stop doing, and continue doing). It can also be a time to add and revise your team norms (if your team is using team norms). Retrospectives are important because they help make your team function smoothly and efficiently. You'll be able to refine your process and prevent recurring problems in your sprints.

Retrospectives are held at the end of one sprint and before the next sprint begins. Usually the suggestions from the retro are directly applied to how the next sprint is tackled by the team.

### How should it be held?

We will be using Github projects on your team's organization to make retrospective boards. Each board will have three columns:

1. Keep Doing
1. Stop Doing
1. Start Doing

Each person will add notes to any of the columns with their personal insights from the sprint that's ending. There's no limit to how many suggestions one person can make, but every person should be involved in adding items, even if it is just to concur with what's already suggested by others.

When everyone has finished entering notes, discuss each item as a team.

If your retrospectives aren't productive, try using the [Sailboat Retro Exercise]('./../exercises/sailboat-retro.md') to spur some good discussions.
