# Sprint Planning Meeting

Sprint planning meetings are held for the team to decide what work they will complete during the sprint. The development team and the manager should both attend this meeting.

### How to hold a planning meeting

1. Review tickets in the backlog (or requirements given by the manager for the project)
1. Using input from the manager, determine order of priority for the work in the backlog
    * consider the work that provides the most value to the user (what is MVP?)
    * consider which tasks have dependencies on other work - you want to carefully prioritize so that any ticket in the sprint can be worked on in any order 
1. Decide which of the highest priority user story tickets your team feels confident can be completed within a sprint
1. As a team, commit to completing those tickets within the sprint. Optionally, you can decide which team members will complete which tickets.
1. Begin your sprint and start development.
