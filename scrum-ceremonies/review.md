# Review

Each ticket in a sprint has to be accepted by your manager as complete in order to be deployed. This is often done by a thumbsup on a pull request or in a discussion between the developer and the manager. In order for a ticket to be accepted, it has to meet the definition of done as defined in your team norms. 

If your team would like to have a formal review meeting, you meet at the end of the sprint and demo each ticket to the team (devs and the manager). If a demo is successful and the developmer has met the definition of done for the ticket, it can be formally accepted during the meeting. Any ticket that doesn't meet the definition of done can't be considered completed within the sprint. This ticket would carry over into the next sprint, or the ticket can be broken into two tickets for the work done each sprint.
