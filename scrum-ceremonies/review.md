Each ticket in a sprint has to be accepted by your manager as complete in order to be deployed. This is often done by a thumbsup on a pull request or in a discussion between the developer and the manager. In order for a ticket to be accepted, it has to meet the definition of done as defined in your team norms. 

After each sprint, you will meet with your manager and demo each ticket of work that you committed to. Any ticket that doesn't meet the definition of done can't be considered completed within the sprint. This ticket would carry over into the next sprint, or the ticket can be broken into smaller tickets in order for it to be completed.
