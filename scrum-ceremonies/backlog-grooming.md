# Backlog Grooming

This process is not one you'll complete often with Bangazon. You should include your manager in this process, because for Banazon projects, your manager can aswer any questions about project requirements.

### When should I do backlog grooming?
* if your team takes a long time in your planning meeting to discuss tickets in extreme detail
* if your team doesn't understand the wording or acceptance criteria of user stories in the backlog
* if your team has confusion about the user story requirements 

### What is Backlog Grooming?

Backlog grooming is a process of getting tickets ready for sprints. Your team will take a draft of a user story and discuss it. You will need to decide if a ticket is too large, receieve clarification about requirements, or reword ambiguous language. The goal of the meeting is to have user stories that can be confidently worked on by any member of your team. 

### How should you do backlog grooming?

Sometimes this process doesn't involve a fixed or physical meeting. Perhaps one team member could throw a potential user story out to the group and the team could discuss it in slack. Identifying potential problems in user stories and correcting them early will help make your planning meetings go much more quickly. This is especially important when there are lingering questions about the requirements.
