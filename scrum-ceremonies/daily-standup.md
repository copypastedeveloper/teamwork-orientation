# Daily Scrum

Daily scrum (or standup) meetings are held every day you work on a project in a sprint.

### Guidelines

1. Meetings should be very quick (less than 15 minutes for a large team)
2. Update teammates on three topics
    * What did you do yesterday?
    * What are you doing today?
    * What are any blockers you have to completing your work?
3. Include your manager in your meeting (use slack for standup if you aren't at NSS)
4. Keep to a regular schedule by meeting at a consistent time and place each day

These meetings are informational in nature - they keep the team up to date about the progress of the sprint. *After you complete standup*, your team can take additional time to resolve blockers, whether that's in a quick team meeting, a one-on-one meetings with teammates, or a meeting between the blocked individual and your manager. Don't try to resolve blockers during the standup meeting because it will take up a lot of time and involve the whole team, which might not be necessary.
