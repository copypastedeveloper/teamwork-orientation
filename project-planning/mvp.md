# Determining Your Project MVP

If your MVP is not gived to you by your manager, you have to decide what part of the functionality of your app is your MVP. MVP is the *minimally viable product* of your app - the bare bones of what your app needs to do in order to meet your basic goals.

Imagine you are giving a big presentation at work first thing in the morning. Assuming your presentation is totally prepared and ready, make a list of everything you would do in the morning to get ready for work if you have an unlimited amount of time (i.e. Wake up to an alarm, exercise, shower, pick out your clothes, eat breakfast, make coffee, feed the kids, check the news, etc.). This is your ideal morning routine. 

**In the application you are building, your ideal project includes every stretch goal you can imagine. This project idea is way too broad and needs to be narrowed down! It's unrealistic!**

Next, think about your normal morning. What are the steps you actually take? If you think that you meet your ideal morning routine on a regular basis, consider what you did this morning. Did you meet your ideal routine this morning or every day this week? What are the steps of your ideal routine that you sometimes skip?

**The normal routine is you final goal for your app. This includes every logical convenience without the bells and whistles your users probably don't need and won't use. This is a realistic final goal, but it isn't your MVP.**

Ok, imagine it's the day of your presentation and your alarm doesn't go off! You wake up with 15 minutes before you have to leave home. What do you do?

**This limited routine is closer to your MVP. This is a very realistic goal for an application. It doesn't do everything your want it to do, but it's still doing the job for your user.**

Imagine again that it's the day of your presentation and you have 5 minutes to leave your house. What do you do? The pieces of your morning routine that you cannot do without, even at risk of being late to give an important presentation of work (and perhaps being fired), is the MVP of your morning routine.

**Consider each proposed piece of functionality for your app and determine if having it will be integral making the app operate. Only the absolutely essential items are your MVP.**
