# Relative Sizing

**If you have tickets that carry on multiple sprints, here's how to resolve that issue**

Sometimes tickets are too large to be completed in one sprint and need to be broken down into multiple tickets or user stories. It's easiest to decide if a ticket is too large by doing a process called relative sizing. In order to do this in your team, follow these steps.

You'll need a whiteboard or a wall and sticky notes.

Divide the board into 5 columns and label them as follows: XS S M L XL. Place a sticky note for each ticket into the columns according to the team's perceived level of effort. Think of XS as less than a hour, and XL as longer than one sprint. Be sure to compare each ticket/user story with the ones already sorted into columns. There shouldn't be a large discrepancy in level of effort estimates in one column.

As you finish with your team and see the layout of all your tickets in the scale, what did you notice? Does your team have a lot of large and extra-large tickets or did your tickets remain on the lower range of the scale?

Any tickets labeled XL should be broken up into multiple user stories or tickets. You team should take any tickets labeled large and consider breaking them down as well. Keep in mind one reason tickets seem large is the uncertainty of how to implement them. Discuss with your team and see if you can iron out some of the details, then check again to see if that changes how you rank your ticket in size.
