# Prioritizing Your Backlog

The low-tech backlog prioritization process involves using index cards and manually sorting the cards into order. Since writing out tickets on index cards is time consuming, you and your team may decide to do this process with your ticketing apps (GitHub projects, Trello, Craft.io) instead. Either way you do it, you should spend time ordering your backlog tickets before you get started writing code.

Things to consider while prioritizing
* **Is the ticket a part of MVP?** Don't do work on your non-MVP tickets until your MVP is met, UNLESS you have no way of working on your MVP tickets. If your teammates are working on the final MVP tickets, try pair programming with them. If you are totally blocked on an MVP ticket, work towards resolution of that issue if at all possible.
* **Does this ticket have a dependency on another ticket?** You don't want to start a ticket and not be able to complete the ticket because you are waiting on a teammate or another ticket to be completed. 
* **What tickets give the greatest value to a user?** These are the tickets that are high priority for your users and give the most immediate relief for their problems. 
* **Will this ticket cause development conflicts with my teammates?** Consider whether you and your teammates will be in the same files at the same time. You want to avoid merge conflicts and not step on each other's toes.

NOTE: You may find once you get started coding that the priority you decided on isn't effective. Feel free to prioritize your tickets as often needed.

ADDTIONAL NOTE: You might find when you are prioritizing your backlog that some of the tickets/acceptance criteria are unclear. Fix the tickets where you can, but if you need to clarify the requirements with someone not present, be sure to move the ticket to the back of the backlog until you can get the needed information.
