# User Story Mapping

User Story Mapping is a tool to visualize the stories you tell about your software. It's an invaluable process to help plan a project from scratch. 

## 1. **Synopsis** 
Outline your project idea. Brainstorm on the *why* of your project: Why are you building this product? What is the problem you are trying to solve? What are the benefits to your users? Write down the high level parts of what your project is doing to do and why you're making it. Think of it like you 30 second elevator pitch.

## 2.  **Personas**
A persona is a description of a potential user of your application. You'll need a persona for each of the user groups of your app. For example, your app may have buyers, sellers, and site administrators, so you'll need a persona for each.

A persona includes
    * User's name and some optional biographical info
    * The pain points for the user in the current system (the problems you will try to solve with your app)
    * The activities the user will complete with the app
    * Additional relevant notes about how the user will interact with the app

## 3. **Map the Stories**

You should have 4 colors of sticky notes. Here's how they are color coded: Personas as one color, activities as another, major tasks (called the backbone) as third, and user stories as fourth.

You'll be making a tree-like structure with your sticky notes. 

At the top is your personas. You'll need a sticky note for each persona.

Next is the activities. These are the high-level tasks the user will do in your app. These should be two words (verb noun), like "reorder priorties", "take orders", "give feedback", or "manage payments". 

Next is the backbone. These are your major features. This breaks down the activity into it's major parts. For example, "give feedback" would need a) assign feedback to user b) display record of feedback c) notify user of feedback d) update feedback (with history)

Each backbone can be broken down further into user stories. These user stories are the technical tasks you will complete as one unit of work. THink of each of these tickets as the smallest piece of functionality one developer can do that gives value to a user.

## 3. **Label your MVP**

For school projects you may have a hard deadline, or for a work or personal project you may like to deploy once the major functionality is completed and have incremental releases after that as additional features are completed. This is why you need to determine your MVP. See [Determining Your MVP](./mvp.md).

If you are using a white board, draw a horizontal line in the middle of the user stories. Consider each user story ticket and move it above or below the line based on whether that story is needed for MVP. 

## 4. **Record your results**

You'll notice that each of the technical tasks is a very granular bit of functionality - independent and small. Take these to make your user story tickets in your GitHub projects, Trello, or other ticketing system. See [writing User Stories](./user-story.md) for more information about that process.
