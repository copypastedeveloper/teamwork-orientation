# Independent Project Planning

In Bangazon, most of your assigned projects are already set up with clear requirements, and you will just be asked to complete a set of predefined tickets. In nearly all development situations, this is exactly what a junior developer will be expected to do. This section is for those projects that you have to start from scratch: your capstone, a pet project, the beginnings of an entreprenuerial adventure, or even possibly some work projects. The point of this section is to help you take a basic idea and get it ready for development.

This planning process will help you refine your idea, fully explain your requirements/MVP, and create a prioritized backlog. The more thorough you are in this process, the easier you'll find organizing the development of your project.
