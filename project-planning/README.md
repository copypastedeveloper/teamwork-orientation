# Independent Project Planning

It's not often you'll be starting a project from scratch. In Bangazon, many of the projects are already set up, and you will just be asked to complete a set of predefined tickets. In nearly all development situations, this is exactly what a junior developer will do. Because the decisions made during set up impact all aspects of future development (and are also very hard to undo), the most senior people on the team make these hard decisions and establish the patterns for future development on a project.

This section is for those projects that you have to start from scratch. These are the projects that you will nuture from the most basic impulse of imagination into a working piece of software. These are projects like your capstone, like a pet project, the beginnings of an entreprenuerial adventure, or even possibly some work projects. This section will help teach you how to a project from the absolute beginning to a finished, polished product.

## Starting with an Idea

Start your project planning by refining your project idea. You should spend extra time in your initial planning and do a user story mapping. At the end of this initial planning stage you should have a prioritized backlog of work to complete with MVP clearly defined. The longer you spend in this process and the more thorough you are, the easier you'll find development of your project.
