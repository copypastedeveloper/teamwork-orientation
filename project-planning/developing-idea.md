# Developing a Project Idea

What is your goal for your project? For your personal projects like your portfolio projects and your capstone, the goal is to develop and *showcase your skills* (so you'll get hired!). Keep in mind that your goals and your project requirements aren't the same thing! 

So, understanding that, what makes a good project idea? 

## How to Showcase Your Skills

What are the skills you want to show off? What have you worked with in class that you like? What do you want to learn more about? You might find you are most motivated to complete work outside of class when the work expands your knowledge in a particular area. 

**What are you passionate about learning?** 

When you pick a project idea, make sure that the project enables you to do more development in that area. Now, you might also want to explore new ground with your projects. Any technology that you are excited about could be incorporated into your projects. The potential new tech to discover is endless, so find stuff you want to explore or sparks your imagination.

Know what tech you want to use and what skills you want to showcase as you plan your project.

## What Makes a Good Project Idea?

What are some of the most popular applications you know of? These apps began with a simple idea to solve a problem.

Facebook - social network for colleges/universities
Google Search - better search engine
Lyft - ride sharing
Instagram - photo sharing
Snapchat - temporary image sharing
Airbnb - room/house-space sharing
Slack - team collaboration

Consider how software could make an aspect of your life better. Solving a problem is key to finding a project you'll want to code. 

Because an idea is simple, it doesn't have to be boring. Those applications became successful because they are simple ideas done well: they solve problems, and they are easy and fun to use. You will make the biggest impact in a demo day or interview environment when your projects are *useful* and *useable*. 

Note: Make projects you find interesting! If you think your project is boring, you will have a hard time staying motivated through the development process. Also, you'll have to discuss your project with prospective employers and others, so you want to do a project that you don't mind talking about!
