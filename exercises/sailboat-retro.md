# Sailboat Retro Meeting

### Instructions

1. On a whiteboard draw a large picture of an tropical island and a boat in the ocean heading towards it. For the purpose of this exercise, the boat is your team and the processes you are using. The island is where you want to get to as a team: project completion and an efficient team process.

2. Draw an anchor from your sailboat into the ocean. As a team, determine what is holding you back from meeting your goals - what processes are inefficient, what issues you are having in development, or any knowledge gaps that are preventing you from working effectively. Make a list of those items by the anchor.

3. In the sky above your boat, make some squiggly lines to show the wind that is pushing your sailboat forward. Make a list as a team of all the processes and tools that are helping you meet your goals. List them in the sky above your boat.

4. As a team, talk through the stuff that's helping you move forward and holding you back. On your drawing by the island, make a list of what your team will need to do in order to be successful and "make it to the island".
