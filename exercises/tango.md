# User Story Mapping Exercise (Tango)

You're going to make a user story map for one piece of a larger project idea. This will help you plan your projects better by forcing you to tailor your features to your users.

### Your App Idea

You (and your team) are going to plan how to make an app that tracks your attendance to coding networking events in town. In the app, you get to leave feedback after an event for the organizers, speakers, and hosts. It can recommend future meetups based on how you rate previous meetups and on the topics you are interested in. You can also see which of your friends go to meetups. The current working name for the app is Tango.

### Your personas

Choose one persona for Tango. Here's a few ideas: 

* Ryan RubyGeek - Ryan is an experienced developer who loves meetups, but Ryan wants to learn something at every time. Ryan has no interest in meetups geared toward beginners. 
* Skylar Student - Just introduced to coding, Skylar wants to meet people as much as learn new material. Skylar is also a little shy and won't go to meetups without knowing someone else who will be there.
* Hayden Host - Hayden works at a prominent tech company in town that hosts many networking events. Hayden's main priority is keeping the company's reputation positive in the community
* Tanner Talker - Tanner loves tech and loves to speak at meetups. Tanner would love a way to get regular feedback after talks.
* Olly Organizer - Olly runs a local meetup group and would like to gain more regular attendees, have fresh content that attendees want to hear (whatever that may be!), and attract great local sponsors. 

You can use any of the above personas or make one of your own. 

### Map It Out

For your selected persona, make a list of the Activities your persona would want to accomplish using Tango, the Potential Pain Points of your persona in how they complete the process now, and any important Notes about the persona that you don't want to forget about as you go further into planning. Keep in mind that everything you include should be from the perspective of that one persona, so don't try to make a list of everything that has to go into this app.

> **PERSONA: {your chosen persona}**
> Activities:
> Potential Pain Points:
> Notes:

Take these activities and complete a full user story map for your persona. 

If you want more practice with this process, pick another persona and keep going.

NOTE: Keep in mind that for creating larger apps, you would have to do this for all of the potential personas.  If your user story map for your personal projects (like your capstone) seem overwhelming, check to make sure that you are refining your project idea. You definitely don't need to redo Meetup.com like we've talked here!
