# Sorting Cards

You'll need a deck of playing cards and around 3 - 5 people.

### Steps

1. Mix up your cards. Shuffle your deck so that some cards are facing forward and some facing back. You card deck should be totally unorganized to start this process.

2. Consider as a team the steps necessary to organize your card deck into pairs of the same colors (pairs would be both red threes or black kings, etc.). Here's a sample step list, but you can adjust this as needed based on how many people are in your group.

    1. Reorder the Cards Facing forward
    2. Remove any Jokers
    3. Sort the deck into colors (red, black)
    4. Sort into suits (hearts, diamonds, spades, clubs)
    5. Sort into pairs
    6. (optional) Order pairs

3. Assign each person in your group one task on the list. Each teammate should be completely finished with their sorting task before the deck is handed to the next teammate. Use a timer and measure how long it takes your team to perform the entire sorting. It seemed to take forever, right? It's inefficient to complete each task sequentially.

4. Remix your deck. You're going to do this sorting process one more time, only this time, instead of waiting for a teammate to be completely finished with their sorting, every 15 seconds pass the sorted cards to the person performing the next step, so they can start the process earlier. Measure your time again. Was this process more efficient?

5. Forget your prewritten steps and decide as a team how to most efficiently sort the deck. Remix your deck and use the timer to measure your team's progress in finding the most efficient sorting process possible. Try a couple different ways until your team finds their sweet spot. If you are doing this process with other groups at the same time, compare your team's process to what other teams come up with. 

Things you should have learned:

1. Make sure you plan your sprints so you don't have dependencies on each other's code.
2. Plan ahead, but don't be afraid to scrap your plans if things change or your team thinks of a better way.
3. Your team should be flexible and work towards efficiency. Don't be afraid to be innovative. Process for process's sake is a drain on team productivity.
