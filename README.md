# Bangazon Employee Handbook

## Rules and Guidelines

Treat all your teammates with respect. That should go without saying.

Keep an open mind. Learning experiences sometimes come from the most unusual places. For example, your teammates come from a wide variety of backgrounds and could provide unexpected insight into solving problems. As a rule, try to listen as much as you speak.

Meet with your teammates and attend all study groups and/or daily meetings with your team unless otherwise approved by your manager.

Follow your team norms. Some of your team norms are set for you by your manager, including how to do pull requests and the definition of done for your tickets. You can establish additional team rules as well. 

Be honest. Reusing and repurposing your own code is totally acceptable (and highly recommended), but presenting another's code as your own is dishonest and is grounds for disciplinary action.
